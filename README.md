# Cryptography-Project
<p>This repository has a project in Cryptography we we're asked to make in college.</p>
<p>The project's requirements were to create a secure communinaction channel by using an asymmetric encryption functionality which we used to pass along a symmetric key for encrypting and decrypting email data between two parties, 
in addition we were asked to add a digital signature by using hashing.</p>
<p>The algorithms used we're RSA for the initial step, CAST-128 for the email data encryption and ElGamal as the digital signature scheme</p>
<H2>Bibliography</H2>
<p>Below are the articles and academic papers that helped us implement the algorithms in python:</p>
